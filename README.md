# Cryptography-and-Pen-testing

Our team intercepted some data in transit and got 2 files. One of these files is a word-list and the other one seems to be a public key. Try to see if you can understand something from it and extract the information needed. The investigation team says it can be used to get the flag.

Part1: Public key is in RSA_Smooth.pdf.

Part2: Word-list is in pass.txt
